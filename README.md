# CognitoAmplify

> CognitoAmplify is a project used to demonstrate the use of AWS Cognito and Amplify in a React Native application. For this application I have utilized the AWS Amplify platform and Cognito to create a user authentication system. This application is a simple React Native application that allows users to sign up, & sign in with help of Social Login as Google and the traditional flow of email & password.

## Key Features of the Application

- AWS Amplify
- AWS Cognito
- Social Login via Google Authentication
